# 📊 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous **Titanic dataset**. The goal is to understand the distribution of various features (like age, gender, and survival status), uncover patterns, and visualize insights using different plots such as bar charts and histograms.

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `Titanic_dataset_EDA.ipynb` – The main Jupyter notebook where EDA is performed.
- `requirements.txt` – A file listing the necessary Python packages.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Load and explore the Titanic dataset.
- Handle missing values appropriately.
- Visualize distributions of:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Survival status
  - Passenger class
- Identify patterns and relationships in the data using visual tools.

---

## 📈 Visualizations Used

- **Histograms** to show the distribution of continuous variables (e.g., Age).
- **Bar charts** to visualize categorical variable distributions (e.g., Gender, Survival).
- **Countplots** to understand how different features relate to survival rates.
- **Boxplots** to explore the spread and outliers in numeric columns.
